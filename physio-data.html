        "phaseDescription": "We encourage all of our athletes to start their rehabilitation plan prior to their surgical date. Studies have shown that rehabilitation performed before ACLR surgery improves functional outcomes and return to play rates. \n\n The key objectives of the pre-operative phase are to minimize swelling and restore knee range of motion. It is beneficial to regain full knee extension prior to surgery as it assists with quad activation and normalizing walking. \n\n The stronger the athlete is going into the surgery, the stronger they will be coming out. After pain and swelling has settled down, and the range of motion increases, supervised rehabilitation consisting of strength and balance work has been shown to maximize long term outcomes. \n\n There is an opportunity to build strength with a focus on the quadriceps and hamstrings. These muscles are the primary stabilizers of the knee and will be the focus of the initial phases post-surgically.",

        "phaseDescription": "The MANAGE phase is the first stage following ACLR. The key objective of this phase is to educate the athlete and manage the symptoms from surgery.\n\n Education and empowerment are essential in all phases of the rehabilitation process. This begins in this first post-surgical phase as the athlete prepares for the rehabilitation journey ahead. It is important to understand that each individuals’ journey is unique and that athletes may progress through the rehabilitation pathway at different paces. The athlete must have a clear understanding of the phase goals and what milestones need to be met to progress to the next phase. This keeps the athlete and rehabilitation team accountable to the process to ensure a safe and efficient return to sport or activity.\n\n Post-surgically, the key focus is to reduce swelling, restore joint motion and re-gain quadriceps muscles activation. Evidence suggests that knee swelling and pain can inhibit quadricep muscle recruitment11-13. Therefore, swelling and pain should be closely monitored and used to guide decisions for early exercise prescription and progressions during the initial recovery. ",

        "phaseDescription": "The objectives of the RESTORE phase are to improve local muscle strength, retrain base movement patterns, and initiate cardiovascular fitness training.\n\n In this phase, there is still significant quadricep weakness and inhibition. In the early stages of rehabilitation, we focus on more ‘isolated’ strengthening techniques (e.g. knee extension/leg press). Of note, 3 months quadriceps strength has been shown to be predictive of better running mechanics at 6 months post surgery.\n\n In the latter half of the phase, we aim to coach and retrain the base movement patterns for athletic development. These exercises include squats, split squats and hip hinge patterns. These movements become the foundation for strength and jump development. There will also be an increase in the challenges of single leg squats and balance training. Low-impact aerobic conditioning including stationary biking, elliptical, or rowing are used to build an athlete’s base fitness in this phase. Running is a high-load task that requires adequate strength and single leg control. Some athletes may start introductory impact type activities such as mini jumps or a walk-run program, but the bulk of this type of training is reserved for hydrotherapy. At Fortius, our Hydroworx underwater treadmill helps athletes run, jump and preform functional movements faster than land based rehab alone, optimizing recovery time.",

The key focuses of this phase are developing strength, running volume and jump ability.\n\n Progressive strength is developed with the guidance of our Performance Rehabilitation Coaches (PRC). The PRC’s role is to bridge the gap between rehabilitation and performance. They provide the athlete with an individualized training program that integrates key lifts with speed work and plyometric jump training. This program is developed in conjunction with the athlete’s physiotherapist and tailored to their specific level of readiness.\n\n In this phase, the physiotherapist will introduce multiplanar movements that typically include side stepping, pivoting, ladder and pre-planned cutting drills. These sessions are coached with feedback on movement strategy and change of direction technique to reduce stress on the surgically repaired knee.\n\n ACLR Team training is also introduced in this phase. Participants are grouped with a PRC coach and other ACLR athletes on a similar timeline to work through small group training sessions. This enables peer-to-peer support and a motivating environment to share their recovery.",

Passing physical and psychological testing does not guarantee a successful return to sport.",
